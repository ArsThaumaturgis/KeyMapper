# KeyMapper
A key-mapping/control-binding module for Panda3D

Includes:
 - The module itself.
 - A test-program, demonstrating basic usage of the module and allowing one to see the output of controls mapped using KeyMapper.
 - An example game (a sort of Lander-gem-collecting-thing), which includes a demonstration of customising KeyMapper.
 - A simple documentation-file with basic information on the use of the module.
 
 Note that KeyMapper does not implement file -saving or -loading methods--the developer is expected to provide those, implemented to their preference. See the documentation-file for more information on this.
